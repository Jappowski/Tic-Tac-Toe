Tic-tac-toe:

Tic-tac-toe is one of the most popular games and at the first sight it might seem quite simple but if we look
at it from a different perspective and try to win every time and predict the moves of other players then it becomes quite interesting and compiled.


Rules:

1.The game is played on a grid which is 5 square by 5 squares.

2.The first person starts the game by being X. He/she places it on an empty field, then the second person who is O thinks over his move and places O to one of the empty fields.

3.The first person to get 5 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game.

4.If all 25 fields have been filled and none of the players have 5 marks in a row then game ends with a draw.
