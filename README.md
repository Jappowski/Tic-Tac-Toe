Tic-tac-toe:

Tic-tac-toe is one of the most popular games and it might seem quite simple but if we look
at it from a different perspective and try to win every time and predict the moves of other players then it becomes quite interesting and compiled


Rules:

1.The game is played on a grid which is 5 square by 5 squares

2.The first person starts the game by being x. She/he places it on an 
empty field, then the second person who is 0 thinks over his move and places 0 *to one of the empty fields

3.The first person to get 5 of her/his marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins the game

4.If all 25 fields have been filled and *none of the players have marks in a row then game ends with a draw
